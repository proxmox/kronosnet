kronosnet (1.12-pve2) pve; urgency=medium

  * invalidate bad MTUs detected on overloaded links. Never go below minimum
    possible MTU to avoid to high packet fragmentation. Rather mark link as
    down and trigger a new PMTU detection cycle.

  * improve defragmentation buffer reclaim logic. This avoids situations where
    packet loss, together with packet sequence overflow, can trigger a
    problematic packet re-assembly with wrong fragments.

kronosnet (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [39a7e15] Revert "GCC already uses SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH"
    This reverts commit 7611955b1e867624f3f1ab6810e3434c544426d0.
    Since configure adds -Werror to CFLAGS by default, the -Wdate-time added
    by dpkg-buildflags broke the build, but unnecessarily: modern gcc
    already uses SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, so reproducibility wasn't broken.
    However, setting CFLAGS directly wasn't a good idea, since it dropped
    the useful (mostly hardening) options as well.
    As the __TIME__ and __DATE__ macros are used in the kronosnetd code
    only, which isn't compiled by default, this setting had better go.
  * [7d0af74] Pristine-tar is used by several gbp subcommands
  * [490655d] New upstream release 1.1 (Closes: #886973)
  * [9b89566] Drop upstreamed patches
  * [5391160] Don't try building Kronosnet on the Hurd.
    It misses both epoll and kevent, our two options. (Closes: #886972)
  * [a532e65] The test suite can already run unprivileged
  * [17d7e7c] Older liblz4 versions are also supported now
  * [f80a59a] Use the official project description
  * [7df074f] Split out the man pages into libknet-doc.
    Building the documentation (man pages) requires extra dependencies and
    effort, spare it if possible.
  * [2fe8f33] Make --as-needed effective by patching libtool
  * [750d039] Switch to dh_missing
